# to do list in project 3
- Add regularization to PDE solver
- Grid search on learning, regularization params and network architecture
- Solve PDE numerically using explicit euler
- Solve last task on computing eig. vec.s and val.s for symmetric matrices
- Put above task in context of solving differential equations (numerically???)
- Write down the analytical solution of the PDE in the report
- Add discussion on specifics for solving PDEs with neural networks, ref Jacobian and Hessian matrices, specify how this was implemented?
- Quick and dirty bias variance tradeoff for regression problem to gain 20 xtra points (last priority)
